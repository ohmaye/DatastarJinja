- I've been porting EFAssistant v4 (FastHTML/HTMX/Datastar/DuckDB) to v5 (FastAPI/Datastar/Jinja2/Duckdb) entirely using Claude-3.7.Sonnet Thinking in Cursor
- Doing it piece by piece because this goes against the grain of the "majority" on which these models were trained (React/Vue/Svelte, client-server world)
- It's taking time, but it is impressive what it can do.
- My own role changes from coder to critic/director. Guiding it step-by-step. It's been about 5 hours of doing so. The progress is slow but I can't say it is bad. And it is probably faster than doing it by hand myself.
